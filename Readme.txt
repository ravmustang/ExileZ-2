Installation

Unpack exilez.pbo
Edit settings in init\fn_init.sqf
Repack exilez.pbo
Place exilez.pbo in @ExileServer\addons
Add "ryanzombies" & "ryanzombiesfunctions" to the "addons" section of your mission.sqm.
 

class Mission
{
	addOns[]=
	{
		"exile_client",
		"Ryanzombies",

How to export Triggers positions:

0. Open arma with NO MODS other than the map you are using
1. Open Eden Editor and DO NOT load a mission file.
2. Place an Elliptic Marker *(not a trigger) on every region you want a spawner and set its radius.
3. Copy Paste the code from GetMarkerCmd.txt inside the debug console
4. Execute the code
5. Open Notepad, CTRL+V  *(Paste)
6. ???
7. Profit !

PS: This is an @ExileServer Add-on for dedicated server only, NOT a mission script. No other script are required on the mission side for it to work.

Configuration

The script is configured to run with Altis with all the features enabled by default. *it's a pretty hardcore config, you might want to adjust it. ;)

All the detailed information related to the configuration is in fn_init.sqf

Please read it.

IMPORTANT NOTE !

Do not create to many triggers, one per town is enough. 
Many trigger per town is pointless as zombies only spawn near players anyway.

Use the performance build to get better performances
